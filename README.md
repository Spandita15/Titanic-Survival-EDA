# Titanic Survival - EDA
## Libraries used -Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
<p>The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a given passenger would have survived based on a number of features, such as their age, gender, and passenger class.</p>
<p>EDA is important as it can help gain insight into the factors that may have influenced a passenger's likelihood of survival. This information can then be used in the development of a machine learning model that can accurately predict which passengers survived the sinking. </p>
<p>Pre-processing the data before applying machine learning algorithms is an important step that can help improve the performance of your model. The preprocessing techniques used here are:</p>
<p>1. Handling missing values</p>
<p>2. Feature Selection</p>
<p>3. Feature Engineering</p>
<p>After prerpocessing, we can train our model.</p>
